# Data

## Data Card

The `dataset.json` contains the metadata of the papers:
  - `title`: title of the paper
  - `authors`: list of authors
  - `abstract`: abstract of the paper
  - `url`: url of the paper
  - `file`: path to the PDF file
  - `images`: path to the images extracted from the PDF file

## Preprocessing

We provide multiple scripts to preprocess data.

- Extract images from PDFs `utils/img2txt.py`
- Extract text from the images: `utils/img2txt.py`
